This first exercise will illustrate the basics of using OpenSSL to generate a private-public key pair. [OpenSSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL) is a software library for applications that provide secure communications over computer networks against eavesdropping, and identify the party at the other end. It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites. 
### Goals
- Understand the process of creating a certificate using OpenSSL or similar
- Understand some of the contents inside a certificate 
- Be able to manipulate a certificate using the CLI


### Instructions

1. Start by generating a Private Key with the following command:

    ```openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048```

    This will generate a private key in the current directory by using the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) algorithm - a relatively slow algorithm that relies on prime number factorisation for security. 

    Note that the two provided arguments above refer to the filename of the private key, and the key length measured in bits - in the case above, 2048 bits. 

2. Inspect the private key by executing 
    ```cat private.key```.




3. Even though the format of the file is text, the actual contents are not very sensible - we can use the following command to extract the information in a manner that is human readable:
```openssl rsa -text -in private.key -noout```

    What do you think these contents represent?

    These are the mathematical parameters used in the creation of the private key, stored in hexadecimal format. As mentioned, RSA uses prime numbers to generate private keys - you can notice terms related to number theory, such as modulus or exponent. More obviously, first prime and second prime indicate the prime numbers used in generating the private key. More info can be found in the RFC for RSA <a href=https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3447#appendix-A.1.1>here</a>

4. As mentioned during the lecture, public and private keys come in pairs. You can extract the public key from the private key that was just generated by running
    ```openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key```

5. Again, let's inspect the decoded contents of the public key:
    ```openssl rsa -text -pubin -in publickey.crt -noout```

        What do you observe?
        <details> 
        <summary>Knowledge checkpoint</summary>
        The mathematical parameters in the decoded public key are a subset of the parameters of the private key, in particular the modulus and exponent. The basis of RSA is that of a one-way (trapdoor) function: Given just these two parameters, it is impossible to determine the other parameters present in the public key, such as the prime numbers used. Hence why it is completely fine to include these in the public key.
